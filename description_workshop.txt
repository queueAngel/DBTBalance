[h1]Dragon Ball Terraria: Rebalanced: Revived[/h1]

A port of Dragon Ball Terraria: Rebalanced to the latest tModLoader version.

[h2]Note[/h2]

This mod is compatible with most versions of Dragon Ball Terraria Legacy, however there are a couple versions after 1.0.0.13 that won't work. If you're using an old version or the most recent one, you'll be fine though.
